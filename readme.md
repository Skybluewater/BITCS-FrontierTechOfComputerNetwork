We use Var-CNN to classify both defence network traces and undefence network traces.

We manually add some assistance program to generate some data.json or data.xls file automatically to accelerate the analysis of classification data.

The accuracy baseline is 80% for undefence traces and 65% for defence traces and we reached the accuracy of 93% for undefence traces and 82% for defence traces and achieved the accuracy of 87% for the ensembled data.

Hope you enjoy a nice day!
